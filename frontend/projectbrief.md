TigerCode: Bridging the Gap Between Algorithms and Interview Prep
1. Motivation and Goal
We noticed that many students learn fundamental data structures and algorithms in COS226 yet still find it challenging to tackle interview-style coding questions effectively. The main issue often lies in recognizing patterns—reusable strategies such as sliding windows, two pointers, or dynamic programming—and then applying them to solve problems under time constraints. The goal of this project is to build a user-friendly frontend that explicitly teaches these interview patterns, connects them to core CS concepts, and offers interactive practice to reinforce learning. My frontend will integrate seamlessly with my partner’s (Ayo) backend system. By placing these patterns front and center, we hope to bridge the gap between theoretical coursework and the practical demands of technical interviews.
2. Related Work
In looking at prior research, I discovered that educators have long recognized the value of teaching programming through pattern-based approaches. Porter (2004)1 conducted an experimental study demonstrating how guiding students to identify and apply patterns leads to stronger conceptual understanding and an ability to adapt known solutions to new scenarios. Even earlier, Wallingford (1996)2 introduced the concept of “pattern languages” for introductory programming, showing how naming and cataloging recurring solutions can help novices structure their thought process more effectively.
More recent studies have turned their attention to how large language models and AI-driven tools might assist in programming education. Shuvo (2025)3 focused on the use of large language models in algorithmic problem solving and also explored the potential of real-time feedback, automated grading, and code explanation to aid in student-learning, all of which align with our project’s goal of offering an AI-assisted practice environment. By leveraging these insights, our plan is to combine the proven effectiveness of pattern-based teaching with emerging AI tools to create a more interactive, hands-on learning experience.
3. Approach
Currently, many online resources for coding interview patterns tend to be text-heavy, with limited opportunities for learning reinforcement or interactive engagement. This project aims to change that by offering a visually appealing interface and practical exercises that reinforce pattern recognition. 
As I am focusing on the front-end development, I will place special emphasis on building a user-friendly, responsive design that delivers a seamless experience. Each pattern will have its own dedicated page outlining the definition, typical use cases, and relevant algorithmic background, supplemented by multiple sample problems so that users can see the pattern in action. A key component of this design will be an interactive quiz feature, where users read a short problem description and select which pattern they believe applies. Immediate feedback will guide them toward the correct solution, along with a brief AI-assisted explanation connecting the problem’s solution to the pattern’s underlying concepts. By centering on the front-end, I can ensure that every user interaction—from viewing pattern pages to taking quizzes—is engaging, informative, and intuitively structured for easy learning. 
4. Implementation Plan
In the first week, I will gather and finalize requirements, including the list of patterns to be covered, wireframes for the website, and a clear plan for user flows. I will also confirm the frontend tech stack, which I anticipate will be React (with Vite for rapid development) and Tailwind CSS for styling. Once I have a solid roadmap, I will begin implementing the core frontend structure in Week 2. This will include setting up the React project, creating the navigation, configuring routes, and ensuring I have a smooth workflow for development and deployment.
During Week 3, I will focus on compiling the content for each pattern. This involves writing concise descriptions, highlighting the algorithmic origins, and providing at least three example problems per pattern. I will also start building the data structures (likely in JSON format) that will power the site’s dynamic rendering. During Weeks 4 and 5, I will start to implement the interactive quiz logic, enabling users to select a pattern as their answer, receive immediate feedback, and view an explanation of why that pattern is correct. Week 6 and 7 will be dedicated to refining the user interface, improving usability, and integrating feedback from initial testers. During this period, I will also conduct more comprehensive testing to confirm that all core features function as intended. I will also start preparing for the Demo Presentation at around this time. 
Finally, in Week 8, I will conduct final testing, polish the interface, and finalize documentation. Throughout the entire project, I will be having weekly integration sessions with my partner, Ayo, to make sure the frontend and backend are seamlessly integrated. 
5. Evaluation Plan
To gauge the effectiveness of the site, I will rely on both quantitative and qualitative measures. On the quantitative side, I will track metrics such as overall engagement (e.g., how much time they spend exploring each pattern page). On the qualitative side, I will gather feedback through short surveys or interviews, aiming to learn whether the interface is intuitive, the explanations are clear, and if users feel more confident about identifying and applying patterns after using the site.
Ultimately, I will consider the project a success if it provides clear, organized explanations of major coding interview patterns, and offers an interactive way to practice them. 
Our hope as a team is that this tool will not only help Princeton students find the transition from class to interview-style questions much better but also serve as a model for combining traditional pattern-based instruction with the possibilities of modern AI tools.
